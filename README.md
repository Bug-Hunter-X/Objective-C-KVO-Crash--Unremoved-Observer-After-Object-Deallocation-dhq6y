This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and memory management.  Failure to remove an observer before the observed object is deallocated leads to a crash. The `bug.m` file shows the problematic code, resulting in a crash upon object deallocation.  The solution, provided in `bugSolution.m`, correctly removes the observer, preventing the crash. This example highlights the importance of meticulous memory management when working with KVO in Objective-C.
