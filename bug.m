In Objective-C, a subtle bug can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management. If an observer is not removed when it's no longer needed, and the observed object is deallocated, it can lead to a crash. This is because the KVO system tries to send notifications to a deallocated object. 

```objectivec
@interface MyObject : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *name;
@end

@implementation MyObject
- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@"MyObject deallocated");
}
@end

@interface MyObserver : NSObject
@end

@implementation MyObserver
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    NSLog(@"KVO notification received");
}
@end

int main() {
    MyObject *obj = [[MyObject alloc] init];
    MyObserver *observer = [[MyObserver alloc] init];
    [obj addObserver:observer forKeyPath:@"name" options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context:NULL];

    obj.name = "New Name";
    [obj removeObserver:observer forKeyPath:@"name"]; // Missing this line causes the crash

    obj = nil; // Deallocates obj

    return 0;
}
```

The missing `removeObserver:` call is the root cause of the crash when `obj` is set to `nil`.
